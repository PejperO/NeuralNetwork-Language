## NeuralNetwork Language
A console application that, using simple artificial intelligence, aims to recognize in which language a given text is written. 

The single-layer neural network learns on a training set in the trainData folder - regardless of the number of folders (provided they are properly described). 

### Testing the files in the testData folder
The program, using the data set in the testData folder, tries to predict in which language each .txt file was written.
